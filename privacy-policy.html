        <h2>Media & Storage Access</h2>
        <p>
            Some of our apps may request access to device storage or media files
            (such as photos or videos) <strong>only to provide app functionality</strong>,
            for example:
        </p>

            <li>Displaying downloaded or saved media</li>
            <li>Allowing users to save videos or images locally</li>
            <li>Managing files created by the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All media access is strictly <strong>local to your device</strong>.

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Our apps may use trusted third-party services for essential functionality,
            analytics, or crash reporting. These services may collect limited,
            non-personal information as governed by their own privacy policies.

        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>
            In case of an app error or crash, diagnostic data may be collected automatically
            through third-party services. This may include device model, OS version,
            app configuration, and crash timestamps.
        </p>
